# igoLib-auto
compared with v4.1,
try to fix the bug in v4.1 preserve_seat_tomorrow.ws4py_py. 
hope that it would work, god bless my code

### afterwards:
it really works!
well, remember, time.sleep(0.01), sleep 0.01s or longer in my_socket.py self.opened() method, otherwise u'll be shocked by the number of msg u send to the server, really.
