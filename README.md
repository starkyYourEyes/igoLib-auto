# igoLib-auto
### ~~ops, i skiped v2.*~~
### brand new v3.0!
<hr>

#### compatible for mutil users, clearer code logic 
#### instead of one send one revc (instaed of revc immediately after send) 
#### before the server starts 0.8s or so, we begin to continiously send without revc!
#### when the server start we revc all the msg we wevc and if still in queue, switch into that one send one revc
*advanced by an attemp to prereserve sear for a HUEL-er, thx a lot.*
